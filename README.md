# End-to-End_ML_Project_with_Deployment

Overview

This project provides an end-to-end machine learning solution for predicting season ratings of players based on their historical performance data. The goal is to assist coaches, analysts, and sports enthusiasts in evaluating player performance across seasons using advanced predictive modeling techniques.

The model leverages data on player statistics over multiple seasons and uses a RandomForestRegressor to predict season ratings. Various performance metrics, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R-squared, are used to assess the accuracy of the predictions.

The model is deployed on Hugging Face, making it accessible for integration into other applications via their inference API, allowing for real-time predictions based on user-provided data. This project highlights the entire machine learning pipelineâ€”from data collection and feature engineering to model deployment.
