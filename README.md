# End-to-End_ML_Project_with_Deployment

** Overview **

This project provides an end-to-end machine learning solution for predicting season ratings of players based on their historical performance data. The goal is to assist coaches, analysts, and sports enthusiasts in evaluating player performance across seasons using advanced predictive modeling techniques.

The model leverages data on player statistics over multiple seasons and uses a RandomForestRegressor to predict season ratings. Various performance metrics, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R-squared, are used to assess the accuracy of the predictions.

The model is deployed on Hugging Face, making it accessible for integration into other applications via their inference API, allowing for real-time predictions based on user-provided data. This project highlights the entire machine learning pipelineâ€”from data collection and feature engineering to model deployment.
This project follows a typical machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model deployment on Hugging Face. Below is an outline of the key components:

** Architecture **

1.  Data Collection and Preprocessing

    Historical player statistics were collected, including features such as goals, assists, playing time, and more across multiple seasons.
    Missing data was handled using median imputation, and categorical variables were transformed using one-hot encoding.
    Feature scaling was applied to standardize the data and ensure uniform feature contribution.

    
2.  Feature Engineering

    Engineered features such as average performance over past seasons and injury history were included to improve prediction accuracy.
    Correlation analysis helped select the most impactful features for the model.


3.  Modeling
        A RandomForestRegressor model was selected due to its robustness in handling complex datasets without requiring extensive tuning.
        Key Hyperparameters:
         Number of Estimators: 100
         Max Depth: 10
        The model was trained on 80% of the dataset, with the remaining 20% used for testing.

4.  Model Evaluation

    Performance metrics used for evaluation:
        Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): 0.85
        R-squared: 0.92
        Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.65
    Cross-validation techniques were applied to ensure the model generalizes well and avoids overfitting.
    
5.  Deployment

    The trained model was deployed using a Flask API, which serves the model predictions via a RESTful web service.
    The Flask app is hosted on Hugging Face, allowing for easy integration with other systems through API calls.
    Users can send requests with player statistics and receive predicted season ratings in real-time via the Flask-based API.

6.  API Integration

    The Flask API handles requests and responses, allowing users to input player data and retrieve predictions in real-time.
    The API is accessible through Hugging Face, providing a scalable and efficient way to serve the model in production environments.
